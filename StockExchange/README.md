# Project in C++


In this project, I developed a cryptocurrency exchange system, encapsulated within a class named "Exchange." The Exchange class offered several key functionalities, including depositing and withdrawing various assets (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and US Dollars), placing buy and sell orders at specified prices, conducting trades, and providing a comprehensive status report of the exchange.

Key functions of the Exchange class:

MakeDeposit and MakeWithdrawl: These functions allowed users to deposit and withdraw assets from their portfolios, ensuring the availability of assets for trading and providing validation to prevent overdrawing.
AddOrder: This function was responsible for placing buy and sell orders, with checks to verify that users had the necessary assets or funds to execute the orders. It implemented market taker and market maker concepts for efficient order matching and trade execution.
PrintUserPortfolios: Users' portfolios were displayed in an organized and alphabetically sorted manner, excluding assets involved in open orders.
PrintUsersOrders and PrintTradeHistory: These functions provided detailed logs of users' open and filled orders, as well as a chronological trade history.
PrintBidAskSpread: The bid-ask spread, reflecting the willingness of buyers and sellers to transact at different price points, was reported for each asset in the exchange.
This project demonstrated my ability to design and implement a rudimentary cryptocurrency exchange, following the principles of trading, market maker/taker dynamics, and real-time order management. It showcased my proficiency in object-oriented programming, data organization, and creating user-friendly interfaces for tracking portfolios, orders, trades, and market data.

In summary, this project served as a testament to my programming skills, particularly in developing financial systems, and my capacity to handle complex data structures and real-time interactions. It was a valuable addition to my portfolio, illustrating my ability to design and implement a functional exchange system for cryptocurrency trading.
